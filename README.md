## Keystroke Logger

This chrome extension functions as a keystroke data logging tool, capturing user input in real-time. It enables users to save the recorded data for various sessions and export them as json files. It's important to note that all user data remains stored locally within the browser, with no transmission to external servers. It's specifically designed to help me collect data for my research. Feel free to modify the code to suit your needs.

The captured data includes the following information:

- Type of event (keydown, keyup)
- Key (e.g. "a", "Enter", "Shift")
- Timestamp (in milliseconds)
- Input id (element's id attribute)
- Input name (element's name attribute)
